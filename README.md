While we recommend everyone read this entire document, maybe you're too lazy...

## If you just want to see what's recommended, here is the [Master list](https://github.com/tl-masterlist/VTuber-Translators-Master-List/blob/master/Master%20List.md).

# Preface
This is a list of **great and decent VTuber translation channels.** It is a growing and ever-changing list of VTuber translators that we collectively recommend to others. There are some small/unknown but excellent translators out there as well, and we want this to be a way to highlight them! Hopefully, with the power of DEMOCRACY™, we can make this work.

**We define “great translations” as translations that maintain consistently good translation quality (accuracy in meaning), often with proper editing and overall clip selection "quality." Their work shows effort and a level of standard and professionalism that respects the VTubers, who are the talents we want to feature.**

Some translators seek to skate by with low effort and clickbaiting at the expense of the VTubers, in order to gain internet fame, AKA “e-peen.” **We understand that unlike anime and manga translations, these are real people that we are translating for.** The english fan community has been growing significantly, and many of them rely completely on translations to understand VTubers. We do not want misunderstandings and rumors to spread.

# Content
While the channels heavily lean towards Hololive content, we are not limiting this list to just Hololive.
There are two categories: “Great Translators” and “Decent Translators.” 

- **Great Translators:** Worth subscribing and following. Their videos are consistently both accurate and entertaining. Respectful of VTubers and shows good faith effort. They seek out feedback from peers to ensure quality. 

- **Decent Translators:** Worth watching their videos, however, YMMV. Possibly might be a group of multiple translators with varying quality. Despite imperfection, you would still recommend them. Decent usually means that with some work or more experience, they could easily become a great translator. We’ll try to provide an **apt description of why this channel is not a “Great” one.**

We will **not** be featuring a list of “bad” translators here. (See why [here](https://link-here))

The names of the groups/translator will be linked to their youtube channel.

We will also feature **Recommended Content Creators**: significant VTuber-related content creators that are worth a recommendation for their MEMES™, editing skills, and or any other significance (e.g. think Chronakai for meme editing skills and Omiya for remixes).

# Contributing
Here are several ways you can contribute to the list:

## Recommending Channels
If you see a channel that is not on the list, check out the [Issues](https://github.com/tl-masterlist/VTuber-Translators-Master-List/issues) page and search whether the channel has been suggested by someone else. Please avoid duplicates! If you can't find them, you may create [a new issue](https://github.com/tl-masterlist/VTuber-Translators-Master-List/issues/new/choose) using one of the templates available deemed appropriate. Please fill in the template as best as possible ([here is a good example to follow](https://github.com/tl-masterlist/VTuber-Translators-Master-List/issues/5)). Add as much information as you can to convince others why they deserve to be on the list!

You may discuss each channel only in their appropriate issue page.

## Translation checks
A translation check is essentially a peer review by other translators/people who are verified to be competent in the language being translated. These people are usually experienced fansubbers/translators that may already be on the list. **We are committed to remain neutral and objective in our reviews (nobody wants drama!). There is no exclusivity in this list.** Everyone already or not yet on the list are subject to constant review. This way we can maintain accountability of the quality of translations each channel produces.

## Adding checked translators
Once checked, they still need to be added to the list. You may fork the list, make the addition, and submit a pull request. Collaborators will check the addition and may modify the submission to adhere to appropriate formats. **Do not submit a pull request for adding unchecked translators!** Only add translators labeled ["TL Checked"](https://github.com/tl-masterlist/VTuber-Translators-Master-List/labels/TL%20Checked)
