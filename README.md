# Preface

This is a list of **great and decent VTuber translation channels.** It is a growing and ever-changing list of JP->ENG VTuber translators that we collectively recommend to others. There are some small/unknown but excellent translators out there as well, and we want this to be a way to highlight them! Hopefully, with the power of DEMOCRACY™, we can make this work.

**We define “great translations” as translations that maintain consistently good translation quality (accuracy in meaning), often with proper editing and overall clip selection "quality." Their work shows effort and a level of standard and professionalism that respects the VTubers, who are the talents we want to feature.**

Some translators seek to skate by with low effort and clickbaiting at the expense of the VTubers, in order to gain internet fame, AKA “e-peen.” **We understand that unlike anime and manga translations, these are real people that we are translating for.** The english fan community has been growing significantly, and many of them rely completely on translations to understand VTubers. We do not want misunderstandings and rumors to spread.

# Content
While the channels heavily lean towards Hololive content, we are not limiting this list to just Hololive.
There are two categories: “Great Translators” and “Decent Translators.” 

- **Great Translators:** Worth subscribing and following. Their videos are consistently both accurate and entertaining. Respectful of VTubers and shows good faith effort. They seek out feedback from peers to ensure quality. 

- **Decent Translators:** Worth watching their videos, however, YMMV. Possibly might be a group of multiple translators with varying quality. Despite imperfection, you would still recommend them. Decent usually means that with some work or more experience, they could easily become a great translator. We’ll try to provide an **apt description of why this channel is not a “Great” one.**

We will **not** be featuring a list of “bad” translators here. 

The names of the groups/translator will be linked to their youtube channel.

We will also feature **Recommended Content Creators**: significant VTuber-related content creators that are worth a recommendation for their MEMES™, editing skills, and or any other significance (e.g. think Chronakai for meme editing skills and Omiya for remixes).
The Changelog will be updated with any changes, including updates to the google forms.

# Instructions
**General edit suggestions:** Make suggestions by using the Comment feature in Gdocs. Accepting suggestions to edit or reword any part of this document, including the introduction and instructions! **Highly suggested to affirm or disagree with any other comments by individuals.**

**Add a channel as a recommendation:** Channel recommendations will be done with voting on Google forms. 

    Google Forms: Located here: https://forms.gle/FWq6BQwxdtiUGDyn7 
    
It will be used to gather votes, either as “great” “decent” “bad” or “Recommended content”. When a certain account is voted as “great”, “decent”, or “Recommended content” by **5 votes**, it will officially be moved to that section. If there is a conflicting vote of “**bad**”, two votes will be needed to “overrule” that. 

> E.g. if YELEL receives a “bad” vote, then there needs to be 6 “great” votes instead of 5 in order to add YELEL to the “great” category.

In v0.1 of this document, the “Great” and “Decent” has already been seeded with recommendations. If you believe that a particular channel is “Great” rather than “Decent”, vote! If it reaches **5 votes** it will change. Unlike the US Elections, your **vote matters!**
Vote rigging will be monitored.

**Short channel descriptions:** We want this list to be helpful. We’re hoping for short (usually up to 3 sentences) for each channel. **The descriptions are not votes, but are helpful and may convince others to vote for or against them.** Helpful descriptions include:
- Why should I subscribe to them?

- Does the channel focus on a particular VTuber(s)? [e.g. Lyger simps for Matsuri]

- Especially for the “Decent” category: if any, what errors or issues do you see sometimes? What justification do you have for still recommending them?

- How do they show a high level of standard?

- Especially for “Recommended Content Creators”: What makes their content noteworthy?

**Nominations of Channels:** Add nominations of other VTuber translation channels in the “Nominations” section. **Please provide at least some explanation/argument.** They will be added to the Pending list if reasonable.
